/*
Given a string A.

Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:

A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.

Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.

If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.



Input Format

The only argument given is string A.
Output Format

    string Solution::solve(string A) {
    string ans="", w;
    stringstream ss(A);
    while(ss>>w)
        ans=" "+w+ans;
    return(ans.substr(1));
}
